# Union Types

## `Input`

An input type for a transaction.

**Types:**

`InputCoin`:
An input type for a coin.

`InputContract`:
An input type for a contract.

`InputMessage`:
An input type for a message.

## `Output`

An output type for a transaction.

**Types:**

`CoinOutput`:
Indicates coins were forwarded from one address to another.

`ContractOutput`:
Indicates the transaction updated the state of a contract.

`MessageOutput`:
Indicates a message output.

`ChangeOutput`:
Indicates that the output's amount may vary based on transaction execution, but is otherwise identical to a Coin output. Output changes are always guaranteed to have an amount of zero since they're only set after execution terminates.

`VariableOutput`:
Similar to `ChangeOutput`, this output type indicates that the output's amount may vary based on transaction execution, but is otherwise identical to a Coin output. On initialization, the amount on variable outputs is zero, but during execution they could be set to a non-zero value.

`ContractCreated`:
Indicates a contract was deployed.

## `TransactionStatus`

The status type of a transaction.

`SubmitedStatus`:
The transaction has been submitted.

`SucessStatus`:
The transaction has succeeded.

`SqueezedOutStatus`<sup>_(beta-2 only)_</sup>:
The transaction was kicked out of the mempool.

`FailureStatus`:
The transaction has failed.
